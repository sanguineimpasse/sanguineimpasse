### Hi! Just hi... yeeeah..... I have nothing else to say really ðŸ˜³
<p>I always loved techy computery stuff, but I've never really learned anything in-depth before I took my major in IT.<br>
  Sooooooo yea... I'm still new here and have far a ways to go before I actually do something functional, or at least - coherent.<br>
  This account will be just me <b>starring</b> some cool projects for the forseeable future. :D
</p>
